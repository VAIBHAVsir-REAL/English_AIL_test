  <h1>Travel Guidelines - Karnataka</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">🛂 Inter-District & Border Rules</h2>
    <p>No E-pass needed for travel within Karnataka, including Coorg. If coming from Kerala or Maharashtra, carry a negative RT-PCR COVID test (≤ 72 hours old). 14-days home quarantine expected—can end early if a second test is negative after 7 days.</p>
    <p>Expect random checkposts (mostly at night). No fees unless documents are incorrect.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">🚍 Transport & Checkpoints</h2>
    <p>KSRTC buses (AC/Volvo) run at ~50% capacity. Expect temperature checks and mask checks.</p>
    <p>Private vehicles may be stopped at checkposts. Valid ID and RC may be asked. Sometimes a small ₹20 fee.</p>
    <p>Avoid late-night travel due to mist, fewer vehicles, and remote checks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">😷 Health & Safety Protocols</h2>
    <p>Masks, hand hygiene, and 2 m distancing are mandatory in public places, hotels, and tourist spots.</p>
    <p>Thermal checks at transport hubs and hotels. Symptomatic travelers are denied entry.</p>
    <p>Self-declaration (travel history, ID) required. Hotels keep this info. Aarogya Setu app is advised.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">🏨 Accommodation & Homestays</h2>
    <p>Only asymptomatic guests allowed. Luggage is sanitized. No room visitors, minimum staff contact.</p>
    <p>Homestays must be registered (max 5–6 rooms, owner must live there). Unregistered ones may be shut.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="emoji">🏛️ Tourist Attractions & Police</h2>
    <p>CCTV, “tourist mitras” (tourist police), and helplines exist but coverage is limited.</p>
    <p>Police may restrict access to major sites. Rely on local guides for timings & tips.</p>
